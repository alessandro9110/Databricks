# MAGIC ## Machine Learning at Scale
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this course, you will gain theoretical and practical knowledge of Apache Spark’s architecture and its application to machine learning workloads within Databricks. You will learn when to use Spark for data preparation, model training, and deployment, while also gaining hands-on experience with Spark ML and pandas APIs on Spark. This course will introduce you to advanced concepts like hyperparameter tuning and scaling Optuna with Spark. This course will use features and concepts introduced in the associate course such as MLflow and Unity Catalog for comprehensive model packaging and governance.
